            <h2>The World of Kindred</h2>
            <p>Long before the kingdoms were fractured, the world of Eloria thrived under a single banner of unity.
                Magic flowed freely through the lands, channeled by nature and spirit alike. But harmony is fragile, and
                balance was broken.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Three Kingdoms</h2>
            <p>Eloria is now divided. The Kingdom of Flame, forged in war and fury. The Faewood Realm, a sanctuary of
                ancient magic. And the Third — a shadowy domain, spoken of only in whispers.</p>
            <p>These three kingdoms were once united. Each ruled by a brother once long ago friends, until the breaking.

        <section>
            <h2>The Brothers' Legend</h2>
            <p>Three brothers were born under the rare celestial alignment known as the Ember Cross. Each touched by
                fate, their bond would reshape the course of history. Raised together, separated by war, and reunited by
                purpose — their journey becomes the core of Kindred's story.</p>
