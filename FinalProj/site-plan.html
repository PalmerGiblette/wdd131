        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My purpose for this site to help me get the continued motivation I need to keep working on furture projects,
            not just for a game.
            But for my coding skills in general. As well as to show that I have been learning these topics and subjects
            for coding, and the skills behind them.</p>

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Gamers, and Godot/Unity Developers</p>
        <!-- change this -->

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>I want to use lightboxes, and well as filtering effects to add a better layer for looks.
            As well as interactions using DOM, for various buttons i'll have within the site itself.
            Finally I want to use arrays to allow for dynamic loading for the pictures I will have in the site.
        </p>

        <h2>Branding</h2>
        <h3>Website Logo</h3>

        <p>This will be mainly images, all dynamically filtered from an array. As to allow for easier management, as
            well as some words to describe the pages
            images, but we will mainly have images. And maybe some videos. But more of just showing off the game itself.
